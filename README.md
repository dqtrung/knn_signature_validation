# Signature validation using KNN

## Idea

- Split image into smaller bins at vertical size.
- Each bin will become attribute value of vector.
- Do above step after rotated image
  - Rotate 45 degree
  - Rotate 90 degree

## Usage

- Go to src/ directory
- python3 main.py

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV 3.2
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
